These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") constitute a binding agreement between the operator of the Ryba Kiva Theatre (a trade name, operated through a privately owned small business - Essek Za'ir - registered in Israel) ("we", "us", "our") and any person who accesses or uses our websites or purchases tickets through them ("you", "user", "customer").
By accessing the website or purchasing a ticket, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, together with our Privacy Policy.

1. General Information
The websites operated under the name Ryba Kiva Theatre are informational websites for theatrical performances and enable the purchase of tickets for specific shows. Each performance may have its own dedicated landing page.
The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Israel, including the Consumer Protection Law, 5741-1981, and the regulations enacted thereunder. Where any conflict exists between these Terms and mandatory provisions of law, the provisions of the law shall prevail.

2. Performances and Tickets
Tickets sold through the websites are electronic tickets delivered digitally (for example, by email in PDF format). In some cases, tickets may be offered free of charge for certain events.
Each ticket is valid only for the specific performance, date, time, and venue indicated on the website at the time of purchase. Performances take place at various venues across Israel or abroad, and seating capacity is limited according to the venue.
Seating at performances is generally unassigned and based on free seating, unless stated otherwise.

3. Eligibility and Audience
Our performances are family-oriented. The recommended age range varies depending on the performance and is specified on the relevant website page.
Children may attend performances only when accompanied by an adult, except in cases of performances held within schools or kindergartens.
Ticket purchases may be made only by individuals legally entitled to enter into binding transactions and who are authorized holders of the payment method used.

4. Prices, Promotions and Early Sales
Ticket prices are displayed on the website and are determined at our sole discretion. Prices may vary over time, including early-bird pricing, discounts, or special promotions.
The price applicable to a ticket is the price displayed at the time the purchase is completed. A change in price after purchase does not entitle the customer to a refund of the price difference.
We reserve the right to modify, limit, or cancel promotions or special offers at any time.

5. Payments
All payments are processed exclusively through the Allpay payment system.
Payment may be made in various currencies, depending on the performance and location.
A transaction is considered completed only after confirmation and approval by Allpay or the relevant financial institution. If the transaction is not approved, the purchase will be canceled and no ticket will be issued.
We do not store or process full credit card details. Payment data is handled directly by Allpay.

6. Ticket Delivery and Entry
Upon successful payment, the customer will receive:
  - A confirmation of successful payment on screen;
  - An electronic ticket sent to the email address provided;
  - A receipt sent by email.
Entry to the performance is subject to presentation of a valid ticket or other confirmation acceptable to us. Late arrival does not guarantee entry at a specific time and is subject to venue policies; however, we generally allow late entry where possible.
Failure to attend a performance ("no-show") does not entitle the customer to a refund. At our discretion and subject to availability, we may allow entry to a different performance.

7. Cancellation, Refunds and Changes
7.1 Customer-Initiated Cancellation
A customer may cancel a ticket purchase up to seven (7) days prior to the scheduled performance date.
Refunds are subject to a cancellation fee equal to the non-refundable payment processing fees charged by the payment service provider.
Cancellation requests must be submitted in writing to our contact email and include sufficient details to identify the transaction.
7.2 Performance Cancellation or Postponement
If a performance is canceled by us, the customer may choose between:
  - A full refund (subject to applicable law), or
  - A ticket for a rescheduled performance or an alternative performance, subject to availability.
If a performance is postponed, the ticket will remain valid for the new date. Customers who cannot attend the new date may request a refund, subject to applicable law.
7.3 Force Majeure
We shall not be liable for cancellation, postponement, or changes resulting from events beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to epidemics, public health restrictions, acts of government, security situations, strikes, natural disasters, or force majeure events. In such cases, refunds or alternatives will be offered in accordance with applicable law.

8. Photography, Video and Intellectual Property
All content related to the performances, including scripts, texts, music, staging, visuals, and branding, is protected by intellectual property laws and remains our property or the property of the respective rights holders.
Audience members are permitted to take photographs and videos during performances and share them publicly, provided that proper credit to Ryba Kiva Theatre is clearly given and such use is non-commercial.

9. Communications
We may communicate with customers regarding their purchase and performance-related updates via email and, where applicable, through WhatsApp groups that the customer has voluntarily joined.
Marketing communications and announcements may be sent only to customers who have given explicit consent and may be withdrawn at any time.

10. Limitation of Liability
Except as required by mandatory law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, consequential, or incidental damages arising from the use of the website or attendance at a performance.
The website and its content are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind.

This Privacy Policy is based on a standard template provided in connection with the Allpay payment system and has been adapted to the specific activities of the Ryba Kiva Theatre.

General Provisions
The name “Ryba Kiva” (also used in Hebrew) is a trade name used for artistic and cultural activity. The theatre does not constitute a separate legal entity. All activities, including ticket sales and website operation, are carried out through a privately owned small business (Essek Za’ir) registered in Israel.
This Privacy Policy is an integral part of the website’s Terms and Conditions. Information about you is collected when you use the website or purchase tickets through it.
Some of the information collected identifies you personally, such as your name, email address, details of tickets purchased, and payment-related information. This is information you knowingly provide, for example, when purchasing a ticket. Other information does not personally identify you and may include technical or aggregated data.
Certain technical data and online identifiers may be considered “Personal Information” under applicable law, including IP address and device identifiers, even if we do not actively use such data for analytics or marketing purposes.
This Policy is intended to comply with applicable Israeli privacy and data protection laws, including the Protection of Privacy Law, 57411981 (including Amendment No. 13), the Protection of Privacy Regulations (Data Security), 57772017, and related regulations, as amended from time to time.

Website and Services
The websites operated under the Ryba Kiva name are informational websites for theatrical performances and allow users to purchase tickets for specific shows. At present, each performance may have its own dedicated landing page (for example: ryba-kiva-zlata.com and ryba-kiva-marita.com).
The websites do not require user registration and do not include personal user accounts.
The websites are available in Russian and Hebrew.

Registration for Services and Ticket Purchase
When purchasing tickets, you may be required to provide certain personal information, including:
	•	Full name;
	•	Email address;
	•	Ticket and performance details;
	•	Payment-related details as described below.
Providing this information is necessary in order to complete the ticket purchase, issue electronic tickets and receipts, and provide customer support if needed.
Providing a telephone number is currently optional and may be requested in the future for service-related purposes only.

Payments
Payments on the websites are processed by Allpay using secure payment systems.
Credit card details are entered directly into Allpay’s payment interface and are processed solely by Allpay. We do not store, process, or have access to full credit card numbers or other sensitive payment data. We may receive limited payment-related information from Allpay, such as confirmation of payment, masked card details, and whether the card is Israeli or foreign.

Use of Information
The information collected is used in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law for the following purposes:
	•	Enabling ticket purchases and providing purchased services;
	•	Issuing electronic tickets and receipts;
	•	Providing customer support and responding to inquiries;
	•	Managing and documenting transactions as required by law;
	•	Improving website content and services, on a limited and nonprofiling basis.
At present, we do not use personal information for advertising or marketing purposes. If, in the future, marketing communications are offered (such as newsletters or WhatsApp groups), this will be done only with your explicit consent.

Providing Information to Third Parties
We do not transfer your personal information to third parties except in the following cases:
	•	To payment service providers (such as Allpay) strictly for the purpose of processing payments;
	•	If required by law, regulation, court order, or legal process;
	•	In the event of a legal dispute involving you and the business;
	•	If the operation of the website is transferred to another entity, provided that such entity undertakes to comply with this Privacy Policy.

Cookies
At present, the websites do not intentionally use cookies or similar technologies for analytics, marketing, or tracking purposes.
If, in the future, cookies are implemented (for example, for basic functionality or analytics tools such as Google Analytics), this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly, and where required by law, appropriate notice and consent mechanisms will be provided.
Users can also manage cookies through their browser settings.

Data Security
We implement reasonable and uptodate information security measures in accordance with Israeli law, including the Protection of Privacy Regulations (Data Security), 57772017. These measures are designed to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to personal information.
However, no security system is completely immune to unauthorized access, and therefore we cannot guarantee absolute security of the information.

	•	Review personal information held about you;
	•	Request correction, update, or deletion of such information, subject to applicable law.

If material changes are made to this Privacy Policy, an updated version will be published on the relevant website. Continued use of the website after such publication constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
